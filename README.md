# different-works
3D - the C# project for working with 3D objects. They are drawn with simple functions of Windows Forms. They support rotating, moving, saling, etc.

Bezier - is the C# project for working with Bezier curves. You just need to place dots which will be processed to draw a curve walking near these dots.

Network analyzer - a complex project, combining pcap-file parsing, algebra algorithms to separate traffic based on different traffic characteristics. The visualizer of the traffic regions is also implemented.

POSIX-pthread - a simple C project to demonstrate the work with threads in unix.

Serial and Parallel Warming/Cooling - a C project with MPI library based on the task of cooling/warming of the plate. Done in serial & parallel ways.

Simple client - server - a C# project demonstrating the TCP server & client work. Server - a calculator. GUI applied.

Token Ring - a C# project which emulated the token ring topology. By executing several exe instances and connecting with each other, we emulate the token ring. We can send a message and also calculate the speed in the token ring.

RGB-HSL - a C# project which allows to switch between rgb & hsl in image. It doesn't store the initial image, so modfiying the H,S,L params can cause interesting and sometimes irreversible effects. The idea is based on the working with pixel buffers to store the changes.
